<div>The set of information that comes with the particle depends on the specific physical system of interest. Mass is always one of the quantities, and it is related to the concept of inertia, which we will explore in moments. An electron, for example, has other defining quantities; the electric charge, and the spin. If we are treating an electron as a classical particle, these measures must be the defining properties of the electron.</div>

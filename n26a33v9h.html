<h2 data-label="869513" class="ltx_title_subsection">Interaction and movement</h2><div>We know movement should be part of the classical mechanical description because changes in the movement state of objects are part of our everyday lives. How can we accommodate the concept in our theory?</div><div>First, we recognize that a universe with a single particle cannot present movement states for the particle. Therefore,&nbsp;<b>the movement&nbsp;</b>must be a property of a system of two or more particles. If we have a universe with two particles, we must allow the particles to interact, in this case, to change their respective states of movement. In the real world, we know by experiment that two particles with values of mass do interact by gravitation. We also know that two particles with electric charge interact by electric and magnetic fields.</div><div>A single particle that does not interact with any other particle is a&nbsp;<b>free particle</b>. Ideally, we may have a system of two or more free particles, i.e., particles that form a mechanical system but do not interact with each other, but this would be a very uninteresting system. We may have a system with several particles that interact among themselves but do not interact with other particles or systems; in this case, we call this a&nbsp;<b>closed system</b>, or an&nbsp;<b>isolated system</b>.</div><div>We may always separate a system of particles, and form sub-systems, by using a definite criterium. For example, a system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span> particles, each with a mass&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m_1\)</span>, and another system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k\in\mathbb{N}\)</span> particles, each with a mass&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m_2\)</span>, may be seen as two sub-systems of a larger system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n+k\)</span> particles with distinct masses. In this case, a system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\)</span> particles may always be seen as <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\)</span> systems, each with a single particle.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="456686">The observer, the measurement, and the observable</h2><div>The&nbsp;<b>observer</b> is a physical system by itself, which possesses rulers, clocks, or any other measurement apparatus. The job of the observer and its tools is to collect information about other physical systems. We call each information possible to be collected from a system a&nbsp;<b>measure</b>. We also use the word&nbsp;<b>measurement</b> for the act of obtaining a measure.</div><div>A measure must refer to a specific characteristic of the system. For example, some curious mind could wonder about the distribution of eye colors in a system of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\)</span> human beings. The colors could be brown, blue, and green, and these are the possible measures of the measurement. At the end of all measurements,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m\)</span> humans will have brown eyes,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k\)</span> humans will have blue eyes, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n-m-k\)</span> humans will present green eyes. The eye color is the characteristic that has been measured by the observer, and it is called the&nbsp;<b>observable</b>. This is not the kind of example we will deal with in the classical mechanical theory but serves to illustrate the point.</div><div>We say that a measure belongs to an observable in the sense that an observer may perform a measurement on the observable, therefore collecting that measure. The set of all possible measures of a single observable is called the&nbsp;<b>spectrum</b> of the observable. In this case, a measurement is the selection of a member of the spectrum.</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="589827">Measurement as the interaction of the observer with the system</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="131420">Statistical issues</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="991300">Type of Observables (intensive and extensive)?</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="389143">Observable dependent and independent measurements</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="338882">The question of consciousness and reality</h2>

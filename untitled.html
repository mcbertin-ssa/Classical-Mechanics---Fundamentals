<h1 class="ltx_title_section" data-label="357463">Introduction</h1><div>The main objective of these notes is the construction of a point of view of classical mechanics, a point of view that allows a closer connection with modern and contemporary physics. The two main theoretical approaches for the understanding of nature since the beginning of the XX century are General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. The first is the set of theories for high speeds and massive structures of the universe. The later is the set of theories that allows us to approach beyond the microscopic phenomena. Both worlds are not disconnected, since high energy physics, as the physics done by the Large Hadron Collider, rellies on relativistic quantum field theory, which is a quantum mechanical theory set up by special relativity.</div><div>Classical mechanics, of course, is a full discipline by itself. It can be learned and developed without reference to any other physical theory. Dynamical systems, orbital dynamics, chaos, and fractal dynamics are examples of modern developments. On the other hand, we live in a world that has molecular and atomic physics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, general and special relativity, quantum information. Our fundamental understanding of nature is coded in the standard model of elementary particles, and the theory of the Big Bang. It is not only a waste to study classical mechanics as a separate subject, but it is imperative to understand how all other physical theories rely on classical mechanics in fundamentals and techniques.</div><div>Here we explore two main ideas. The first one is that physics is the science that maps natural phenomena into mathematical structures. The other idea is that a physical system is only as definable as it can be measured, and the information that defines a system is the one all observers in a specified class of observers agree.</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section" data-label="727904">Basic concepts and structures</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="840858">The particle</h2><div>Some concepts that gave origin to classical mechanics are just too classical. We must have them here even if we came to suffer significantly to get rid of them when necessary. And the most basic of all classical concepts is&nbsp;<b>the particle</b>\label{word: the particle}.</div><div>In classical mechanics, a particle is an eternal smallest element. It is a brick that builds everything that exists. Particles are the building blocks of any physical system. A particle has no size, no internal structure, but has some information attached. Typically, the information that comes with the particle is the&nbsp;<b>mass</b>, \label{word: mass}, but it can also include other observables, as the&nbsp;<b>electric charge</b>\label{word: charge}, the spin\label{word: spin}, or additional internal charges. By eternal, we mean that a particle cannot be created or destroyed. A particle exists.</div>

<h1 data-label="357463" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>The main objective of these notes is the construction of a point of view of classical mechanics, a point of view that allows a closer connection with modern and contemporary physics. Relativity, special and general, and quantum physics are the two main theoretical approaches for the understanding of nature since the beginning of the XX century. The first is the set of theories for high speeds and large structures of the universe. The later is the set of theories that allows us to approach beyond the microscopic phenomena. Both worlds are not disconnected, since high energy physics, as the physics done by the Large Hadron Collider, rellies on relativistic quantum field theory, which is a quantum mechanical theory set up by special relativity.</div><div>Classical mechanics, of course, is a full discipline by itself. It can be learned and developed without reference to any other physical theory. Dynamical systems, orbital dynamics, chaos, and fractal dynamics are examples of modern developments. On the other hand, we live in a world that has molecular and atomic physics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, general and special relativity, quantum information. Our fundamental understanding of nature is coded in the standard model of elementary particles, and in the theory of Big Bang. It is not only a waste to study classical mechanics as a separate subject, but it is imperative to understand how all other physical theories rely on classical mechanics in fundamentals and techniques.</div><div>Here we explore two main ideas. The first one is that physics is the science that maps natural phenomena into mathematical structures. The second idea is that a physical system is only as definable as it can be measured. And the information that defines a system is the one all observers in a defined class of observers agree.</div><h1 data-label="727904" class="ltx_title_section">Basic concepts and structures</h1><div>Some concepts that gave origin to classical mechanics are just too classical. We must have them here even if we came to suffer greatly to get rid of them when necessary. And the most basic of all classical concepts is the <b>particle</b>.</div><div>In classical mechanics, a particle is an eternal smallest element. It is a brick that builds everything that exists. Particles are the building blocks of any physical system. A particle has no size, no internal structure, but has some information attached. Typically, the information that comes with the particle is the&nbsp;<b>mass</b>. But it can also include other measures, as the electric charge. By eternal, we mean that a particle cannot be created or destroyed. A particle just exists.</div><div>Of course, this concept of a particle does not have any real correspondence in nature. The real world has extended bodies, formed by molecules,  atoms of many types, which are formed by electrons, protons, and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are, then, formed by other basic structures known as quarks. Electrons are elementary by themselves. However, quarks and electrons cannot be described as classical particles, because eventually, this concept will not be sufficient to describe nature.

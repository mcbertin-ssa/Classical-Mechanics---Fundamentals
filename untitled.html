<h1 class="ltx_title_section" data-label="357463">Introduction</h1><div>The main objective of these notes is the construction of a point of view of classical mechanics, a point of view that allows a closer connection with modern and contemporary physics. The two main theoretical approaches for the understanding of nature since the beginning of the XX century are General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. The first is the set of theories for high speeds and massive structures of the universe. The later is the set of theories that allows us to approach beyond the microscopic phenomena. Both worlds are not disconnected, since high energy physics, as the physics done by the Large Hadron Collider, rellies on relativistic quantum field theory, which is a quantum mechanical theory set up by special relativity.</div><div></div>

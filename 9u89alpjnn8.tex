We may always separate a system of particles, and form sub-systems, by using a definite criterium. For example, a system with $n\in\mathbb{N}$ particles, each with a mass $m_1$, and another system with $k\in\mathbb{N}$ particles, each with mass m2m_2m2​​, may be seen as two sub-systems of a larger system with n+kn+kn+k​ particles with distinct masses. \footnote{Here, N\mathbb{N}N​ represents the set of natural numbers.}

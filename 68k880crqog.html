The job of the observer, and its tools, is to collect information about other physical systems.

We also use the word&nbsp;<b>measurement</b>\label{word: measurement} for the act of collecting a measure.</div><div>A measure must refer to a certain characteristic of the system. For example, some curious mind could wonder about the distribution of eyes colors in a system of&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\)</span> human beings. The colors could be brown, blue and green, and these are the possible mesures of the measurement., At the end of all measurements&nbsp;</div><div></div>

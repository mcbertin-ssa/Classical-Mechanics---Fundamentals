Let us take a closed system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\)</span> particles with different masses, and the particles are allowed to interact internally. Therefore, each particle will have its state of movement dependent only on the other particles and their states. Here, we understand the state of movement as a set of additional information concerning the particle and its condition compared with the other particles.</div><div></div>

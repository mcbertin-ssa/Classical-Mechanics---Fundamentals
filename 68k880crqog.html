<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="780249">The observer, the measurement, and the observable</h2><div>The&nbsp;<b>observer</b>\label{word: observer} is a physical system by itself, which possesses rulers, clocks or any other measurement apparatus. The job of the observer, and its tools, is to collect information about other physical systems. We call each information possible to be collected from a system a&nbsp;<b>measure</b>\label{word: measure}. We also use the word&nbsp;<b>measurement</b>\label{word: measurement} for the act of collecting a measure.</div><div>A measure must refer to a certain characteristic of the system. For example, some curious mind could wonder about the distribution of eye colors in a system of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\)</span> human beings. The colors could be brown, blue and green, and these are the possible measures of the measurement. At the end of all measurements,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m\)</span> humans will have brown eyes,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k\)</span> humans will have blue eyes, and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n-m-k\)</span> humans will present green eyes. The eye color is the characteristic that has been measured by the observer, and it is called the&nbsp;<b>observable</b>\label{word: observable}. This is not the kind of example we will deal with in the classical mechanical theory but serves to illustrate the point.</div><div>We say that a measure belongs to an observable in the sense that an observer may perform a measurement on the observable, therefore collecting that measure. The set of all possible measures of a single observable is called the&nbsp;<b>spectrum</b>\label{word: spectrum} of the observable. In this case, a measurement is the selection of a member of the spectrum.</div><div>Measurement&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>

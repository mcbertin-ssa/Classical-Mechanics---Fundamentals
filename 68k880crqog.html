<div>We may always separate a system of particles, and form sub-systems, by using a definite criterium. For example, a system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>&nbsp;particles, each with mass&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m_1\)</span>, and another system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k\in\mathbb{N}\)</span> particles, each with mass&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m_2\)</span>, may be seen as two sub-systems of a larger system with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(n+k\)</span> particles with distinct masses. \footnote{Here, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> represents the set of natural numbers.}</div>

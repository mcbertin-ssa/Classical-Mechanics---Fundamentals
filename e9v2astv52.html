<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="589827">Interaction of the observer with the system</h2><div>For the observer, the physical way to perform a measurement is to interact with the system. Since the observer is also a physical system, therefore made of interacting particles by itself, the interaction may change the state of movement of both systems.  However, in classical mechanics, this interaction can be made very small. The ideal measurement is the one the observer and the system are isolated from each other, and this is the way physicists thought to be the nature of measurement until the rise of quantum mechanics. In the real world, it is impossible to measure without interaction.</div><div>Let us say we want to gather information about a soccer ball. The data could be, again, its color.&nbsp;The first thing we could do is to shed light on the ball, so the system which interacts directly with the ball is a bean of light. Light itself is a physical system, but not a mechanical one. It can be seen here as an electromagnetic field wave, certainly outside of the domain of classical mechanics. But this is a case when a classic particle description can be used to discuss the matter at hand. To collect the measure, however, the observer must somehow interact with the light scattered by the ball, maybe with a camera. The camera must also send information to a computer, for the final answer about the color of the ball. Of course, the camera can be substituted by a human eye, and the computer can be replaced by a human brain.</div><div>The interaction between the soccer ball and the beam of light can be negligible, or not, depending on the properties of the beam itself, compared with the properties of the ball. Tipically, if the beam is made of visible light</div><div>The interaction of the light with the ball is small.</div><div>Interaction can be made strong, rising the intensity of the light.</div><div>Light does not have mass but exerts pressure.</div><div>Interaction is minimal if the light is not very intense, then the movement properties of the ball are not modified in a sensible way.</div>

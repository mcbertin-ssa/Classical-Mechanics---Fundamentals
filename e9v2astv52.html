<h2 data-label="589827" class="ltx_title_subsection">Interaction of the observer with the system</h2><div>For the observer, the physical way to perform a measurement is to interact with the system. Since the observer is also a physical system, therefore made of interacting particles by itself, the interaction may change the state of movement of both systems.  However, in classical mechanics, this interaction can be made very small. The ideal measurement is the one the observer and the system are isolated from each other, and this is the way physicists thought to be the nature of measurement until the rise of quantum mechanics. In the real world, it is impossible to measure without interaction.</div><div>Let us say we want to gather information about a soccer ball. The data could be its color, size, weight, or any other observable.&nbsp;For now, we are avoiding to use physical observers we'll define later. The first thing we need to do is to shed light on the ball. For example, interacting white light with the surface makes possible to determine the color. In this case the observer needs its ow</div><div></div>

<h2 data-label="589827" class="ltx_title_subsection">Interaction of the observer with the system</h2><div>For the observer, the physical way to perform a measurement is to interact with the system. Since the observer is also a physical system, therefore made of interacting particles by itself, the interaction may change the state of movement of both systems.  However, in classical mechanics, this interaction can be made very small. The ideal measurement is the one the observer and the system are isolated from each other, and this is the way physicists thought to be the nature of measurement until the rise of quantum mechanics. In the real world, it is impossible to measure without interaction.</div><div>Let us say we want to gather information about a soccer ball. The data could be, again, its color.&nbsp;The first thing we could do is to shed light on the ball, so the system which interacts directly with the ball is a beam of white light. Light itself is a physical system, but not a mechanical one. It can be seen here as an electromagnetic field wave, certainly outside of the domain of classical mechanics. But this is a case when a classic particle description can be used to discuss the matter at hand. To collect the measure, however, the observer must somehow interact with the light scattered by the ball, maybe with a camera. The camera must also send information to a computer, for the final answer about the color of the ball. Of course, the camera can be substituted by a human eye, and the computer can be replaced by a human brain.</div><div>The interaction between the soccer ball and the beam can be negligible or not, depending on the properties of the beam itself, compared with those of the ball. Typically, we may adjust the intensity of the light, so the interaction becomes too weak to result in any measurable changes in the state of the ball. Therefore, we can use this set up to measure the color of the ball without sensible interference of the measurement process.</div><div>On the other hand, if we raise the intensity of the light, characteristics of the ball start to suffer interference of the measurement itself. Consequently, measuring the color of a ball with too intense light will destroy the very information you aspire to collect in the first place. It is well known that a sufficiently strong beam could set a ball on fire.</div><div>In classical mechanics, we will always suppose that the interaction between observer and physical system&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div>

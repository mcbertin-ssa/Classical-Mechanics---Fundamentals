<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="589827">Interaction of the observer with the system</h2><div>For the observer, the physical way to perform a measurement is to interact with the system. Since the observer is also a physical system, therefore made of interacting particles by itself, the interaction may change the state of movement of both systems. In the real world, it is impossible to measure without interaction. However, in classical mechanics, this interaction can be made very small. The ideal measurement is the one the observer and the system are isolated from each other.

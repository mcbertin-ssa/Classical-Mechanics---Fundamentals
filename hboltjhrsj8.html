<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="225625">The statistical nature of the measurement</h2><div>We defined the measurement as a process of separate a single value or a subset from a spectrum, which is the set of all possible measurements. It is a philosophical matter which of the values is the "true" measure of the observable, or even if we can speak of a true measure at all. It is possible to adopt the platonic point of view in classical mechanics, which is of the existence of an actual value for the observable. In this case, repeated experiments have the purpose of bringing us closer to the true measure, since a single observation has always an error to be considered.</div><div>However, this approach to the measurement process finds serious difficulties in quantum physics, where the result of an experiment highly depends on the observable. This is the origin of the very well known particle-wave duality observed in double split experiments&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{experiment,interference,studios}</cite>.

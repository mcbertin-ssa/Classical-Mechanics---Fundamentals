It is a philosophical matter which of the values is the "true" measure of the observable, or even if we can speak of a true measure at all. It is possible to adopt the platonic point of view in classical mechanics, which is of the existence of an actual value for the observable. In this case, repeated experiments have the purpose of bringing us closer to the true measure, since a single observation has always an error to be considered.</div><div>However, this approach to the measurement process finds seri</div>

<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="225625">The statistical nature of the measurement</h2><div>We defined the measurement as a process of separate a single value or a subset from a spectrum, which is the set of all possible measurements. It is a philosophical matter which of the values is the "true" measure of the observable, or even if we can speak of a "true" measure at all. It is possible to adopt the platonic point of view in classical mechanics, which is of the existence of an actual value for the observable. In this case, repeated experiments have the purpose of bringing us closer to the "true" measure, since a single observation has always an error to be considered.</div><div>However, this approach to the measurement process finds serious difficulties in quantum physics, where the result of an experiment highly depends on the observable. This is the origin of the very well known particle-wave duality observed in double split experiments&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{experiment,interference,studios}</cite>. Therefore, a general measure theory can not relies on the assuption of the existence of a true measure, and we really wish to be as close as possible of a general concept of measurement.</div><div>In this case, we assume that the result of a measurement of an observable is aleatory within the range of the spectrum. This means that any value of the spectrum can be selected by a single measurement, and there is no way to predict the result. There is no "true" measure. The best we can do is to perform several measurements in sequence, always taking care so the physical system is set to the same state</div><div></div><div></div>

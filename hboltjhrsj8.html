<h2 data-label="225625" class="ltx_title_subsection">The statistical nature of the measurement</h2><div>We defined the measurement as a process of separate a single value or a subset from a spectrum, which is the set of all possible measurements. It is a philosophical matter which of the values is the "true" measure of the observable, or even if we can speak of a true measure at all. It is possible to adopt the platonic point of view in classical mechanics, that is of the existence of a true value for the measurement</div>
